Development environment for the [OSM Blog Collector](https://github.com/TheFive/osmbc)

Provides the OSM Blog Collector locally at https://localhost:35043 - self-signed certificates have to be accepted.

Currently no demo database can be created, a dump is required. For login, the user `test` with password `test` can be used via `htaccess` method, but `access` needs to be set to `full` in postgres `usert` manually for full functionality.
